# FastReset

## This addon is made for players who want to complete trifectas in trials with their groups.

### Are you tierd of resetting the instance all the time? Port out, port back in? Then someone forgets to refill his ultimate & the first trash starts without a horn or collos? Me to! All the time wasted between the tries because there is ALWAYS someone who f*cks it up.

### Then maybe this addon is for you and your group. It should be used by all members to be most effective.


It automates some predefined tasks, and chaines them together to speed up the proces of resetting and rejoining an instance
when someone dies, it automatically ports the team out!


- if you are the leader, resetting will be done automatically for you after you left the instance
- when enabled, it ports you to a house with an ulti-refill-station and waits for you to fill it up *
- it then starts looking for your group leader. If he ports back into the trial, it ports you to him.
- after that you can do another try!

No longer waste any time. Just do it!

* you have to set the house first where you want to get ported to. Do this in the addonsettings

If you can do a little translation work for me, let me know. Currently the addon is only translated to english and german
